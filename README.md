# moshi-gson-interop

A tool for bidirectional interop between Moshi and Gson.

This is targeted at codebases that are in the process of migrating from Gson _to_ Moshi and not a
general-purpose tool that should be used for other reasons.

## Usage

In order to properly link two `Moshi` and `Gson` instances, you must pass two _complete_
instances (i.e. not intended to `newBuilder()` later) to `Moshi.interopWith()` and use
the returned instances.

```kotlin
val seedMoshi: Moshi = ...
val seedGson: Gson = ...

// Use the returned instances!
val (moshi, gson) = seedMoshi.interopWith(seedGson)
```

By default, the interop mechanism will attempt to best-guess which serializer to use based on a combination
of things (see `DefaultMoshiClassChecker`'s kdoc). You can alternatively provide your own logic for this.

## Installation

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation("com.slack.moshi:gson-interop:<version>")
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].

## Caveats

* JsonQualifiers on a type in a Gson class will not be passed on to Moshi, as Gson (and the various
  tools around it) don't capture them.
* Performance
  * A Moshi adapter delegating to Gson should have no performance issues as it is able
    to stream data directly.
  * Streaming from Gson to Moshi will, however, be degraded as Gson has no equivalent
    streaming APIs to Moshi's `nextSource()` or `valueSink()` APIs. This means that it
    must either decode the entire source into an intermediary object (i.e. a Map, List,
    etc) first when reading or encode the entire value into a JSON String first when writing.
